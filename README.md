# Baldur's Gate Theme

## About

Infinity Engine Incredible Editor **Baldur's Gate Theme** is CSS (and some JS) theme used in **IEIE Interface**.

I've decided to create separated repository for it, in case somebody needs to create *Baldur's Gate* related webpage or something.

**Baldur's Gate Theme** tries to mimic style of original *Baldur's Gate* (1) interface. The primary component is texture, which I've created by myself from scratch. It surely looks like granite (but my personal thought is that it could be more 3d stone, than flat and polished one - will look at it some day).

## Theme includes

- Primary texture
- Styles for making 3d chiseled (shaded) elements out of flat boxes
- Original scrollbar (based on [malihu custom scrollbar](http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller/) and BG graphic files)
- Fonts
- Styles for fonts to make them a bit shaded
- Support for forms
- and something I've propably forgot about
